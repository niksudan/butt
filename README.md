# butt [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/niksudan/butt.svg)](https://github.com/niksudan/butt/releases) [![Add to Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Add%20to-Discord-7289da.svg)](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=174147031172907017&scope=bot&permissions=0)

A Discord bot that's all about toilet humor.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE

Since [Discord's changes to the way it's API works in September 2022](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8541214983959-Developer-ToS-and-Policy-Updates), Butt Bot is unfortunately no longer working, and will not work in the forseeable future. I hope you had a flatulent time with it!
